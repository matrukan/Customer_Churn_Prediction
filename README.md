# 🧠 Customer Churn Prediction

Predict which customers are likely to churn using machine learning techniques and provide actionable insights to improve customer retention.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to:
- Predict customer churn using historical behavior data
- Identify key factors contributing to churn
- Deliver insights that help the business take preventive action
- Build a repeatable pipeline for future churn analysis

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Customer churn has a direct impact on recurring revenue. By predicting which customers are at risk of leaving and understanding why, companies can reduce churn through targeted retention strategies.
